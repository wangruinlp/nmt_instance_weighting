We are sorry that we need an internal processing for the online available codes. We would realease it once the internal processing was approved.

For the batch weighting method, you can refer to the original Nematus settings. https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus/blob/master/nematus/domain_interpolation_data_iterator.py
